# Advices App

App developed in React.js, it's for showing some advices as a tutorial, in which with two buttons users can move forward and backward in the tips, modifying the help text and the background image. As I don't have yet the final data, I use a json file with some histories.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
